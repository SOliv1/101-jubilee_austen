Next up is the Explore page, which you can access by clicking Explore on the top menu. The Explore page has repo recommendations based on your past activity on GitHub. For example, if you’ve previously searched for JavaScript repos, your Explore page will likely recommend repos related to JavaScript… like this JavaScript React repo!

Another way to find inspiring content is by looking at the Collections page. 

You can access collections by going to github.com/collections. 

Collections are groups of repos focused around a specific subject. *Collections* can be helpful when you’re looking for multiple resources on the same topic, like open-source text editors. 

To help you continue to grow your tech skills, I recommend the Learn to Code collection. And the *GitHub Pages collection* is great if you want to see examples of excellent websites hosted on GitHub Pages.
